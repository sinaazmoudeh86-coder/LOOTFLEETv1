   patch-notes.js — LOOTFLEET · "WHAT'S NEW" ON FIRST LOGIN TO A NEW BUILD
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Shows one card, once, the first time a player logs in after a build ships.

   WHAT GOES ON THIS CARD — the editorial rule, because it is the whole job:
   ONLY things a PLAYER can see, feel, or must act on. Not everything that
   changed in a build is player information. A migration, a refactor, a renamed
   function, a cache header — those are operator facts, and putting them here
   trains people to close the card without reading it, which costs us the one
   time it really matters.

   The test for each line: **would a player notice if we never told them?**
     · Their 5× speed pill is gone            → YES. Must be here.
     · Cargo runs stopped dropping fittings   → YES. A nerf. Must be here.
     · Their leaderboard row was frozen       → YES. They saw it and complained.
     · lb_upsert dropped an overload          → NO. That is a deploy note.
     · Loot blocking became one predicate     → NO. Same behaviour, better code.
     · A reserved rarity tier exists          → NO. It is not live. Saying so
                                                 just promises something absent.

   TONE: short, punchy, one line each. A player reads this in fifteen seconds
   standing in a queue. Anything longer is a changelog, and the changelog lives
   on the site.

   WHAT A NERF OWES THE PLAYER: it gets said out loud, in plain words, with what
   they keep. Silent removal of something a player is holding reads exactly like
   a bug — see CLAUDE.md. That is why the speed tiers and the cargo loot change
   lead the CHANGED block rather than hiding at the bottom of it.
